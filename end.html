        <h1>ðŸ’™ The Truth Behind the Confession</h1>
        <p>You traced every cipher, uncovered every layer of hidden meaning, and finally found the one heart that spoke plainlyâ€”</p>
        
        <h2>It was <span style="color:#5ac8fa;">Nova</span>.</h2>

        <p>In a world of code and chaos, where the stars whisper secrets and duty often overshadows desire, only one dared to say it simply:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <em>"CTF{love}"</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Orion couldn't speak the words aloud, but through the binary, through the clues, you heard him.  
        You've uncovered not just a messageâ€”but a feeling, a confession veiled in code.</p>

        <p>Well done, Ceres. The truth was written in the starsâ€”and you found it.</p>
